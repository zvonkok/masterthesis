\chapter{Mean Shift Algorithm Design} % (fold)
\label{cha:algorithm_design}
The previous chapter explained and showed what is gonna be done to the algorihtm
to have it running on a \gls{GPU}. In this chapter it will be explained how all
the proposals are realized and how everything is put together. The result is an
scalable and efficient realization of the mean shift algorithm on the \gls{GPU}.
