explains how the PPM image is read in
and written back to. cutLoadPPM4ub() function reads the PPM file which is in RGB
(0-255) format and pads a zero to the fourth byte, thereby making the data to be
four bytes in total. This padding is very helpful because memory coalescence and
better performance is achieved by accessing 1/2/4 consecutive memory locations
at a time.
