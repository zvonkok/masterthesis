First of all this thesis was done completely in the free time beside a regular 
job.  The begining of the thesis was in sync with the time plan provided in the 
interim report. Milestone 1--4 were successfully accomplished with satisfying
results. The reason for the success of the first four milestones was the fact 
that the current project in the regular job was not very exhausting. 

The situation changed when the project began to get larger. The result was
overtime and a lot of work. The remaining free time was not enough to make
considerable progress. Milestone 5 delayed by 2 months. 

Out of sudden a family member got ill and care had to be taken, lasting almost
a complete year. The remaining milestones were done \emph{in between} care taking,
household, \ldots. The initial time plan was completely out of sync for at last
the milestones 5--9. 

Nevertheless the thesis is finished by 5/31/2010 exactly one year after the
initial time plan.
