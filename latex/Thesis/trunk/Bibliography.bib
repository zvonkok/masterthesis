	abstract = {Recently, graphics processors have emerged as a powerful computational platform. A variety of encouraging results, mostly from researchers using GPUs to accelerate scientific computing and visualization applications, have shown that significant speedups can be achieved by applying GPUs to data-parallel computational problems. However, attaining these speedups requires knowledge of GPU programming and architecture.The preceding chapters have described the architecture of modern GPUs and the trends that govern their performance and design. Continuing from the concepts introduced in those chapters, in this chapter we present intuitive mappings of standard computational concepts onto the special-purpose features of GPUs. After presenting the basics, we introduce a simple GPU programming framework and demonstrate the use of the framework in a short sample program.},

Over the past six years, there has been a marked increase in the performance and capabilities of GPUs. The modern GPU is not only a powerful graphics engine but also a highly parallel programmable processor featuring peak arithmetic and memory bandwidth that substantially outpaces its CPU counterpart. The GPU's rapid increase in both programmability and capability has spawned a research community that has successfully mapped a broad range of computationally demanding, complex problems to the GPU. This effort in <emphasis emphasistype="boldital">general-purpose computing on the GPU,</emphasis> also known as <emphasis emphasistype="boldital">GPU computing,</emphasis> has positioned the GPU as a compelling alternative to traditional microprocessors in high-performance computer systems of the future. We describe the background, hardware, and programming model for GPU computing, summarize the state of the art in tools and techniques, and present four GPU computing successes in game physics and computational biophysics that deliver order-of-magnitude performance gains over optimized CPU applications. </para>},

We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware.},

@mastersthesis{citeulike:80546,
	abstract = {En route to ever larger processor performance, processor designers are facing
complex problems to the conventional way of performance improvement. To cover
the rising demand of computing power many manufactures take meanwhile multi-core
chip design into consideration. IBM, Sony and Toshiba developed therefore a new
processor architecture the Cell Broadband Engine (CBE) which promise a variety
of performance bene?ts. To achieve a high degree of par - allelism the CBE
unites a pipeline, multi core architecture with simultaneous multi threading on
a highly integrated chip. The CBE combines a Power Processor Element (PPE) and
eight Synergetic Processing Elements (SPE). The SPU is a RISC processor with a
128-bit single in- struction multiple data (SIMD) unit for single and double
precision computation which handles the most computational workload. The PPE
acts like a control or monitoring system for the rest of the system. To solve a
speci?c task entirely new approaches have to be developed. This not only results
in adapting the task to the architecture, but it also results in a variety of
approaches which have to be taken into account to solve a given problem. With
respect to its performance and adaptability each approach has to be tested to
determine the best solution. The problem that yields out of that situation will
be examined for a ray tracer which will be adapted to the CBE architecture. In
the frame of this work, dif ferent approaches are supposed to be introduced
whereby the single approaches with respect to its performance and its capability
for ray tracing are examined. Goal of the work is to develop an optimized
architecture for ray tracing on the CBE with focus on performance. As a result,
this optimized architecture will be able to render medium sized scenes at
accept- able rates.},

In a simplified form, this information is stored in a tree of "rays" extending from the viewer to the first surface encountered and from there to other surfaces and to the light sources. A visible surface algorithm creates this tree for each pixel of the display and passes it to the shader. The shader then traverses the tree to determine the intensity of the light received by the viewer. Consideration of all of these factors allows the shader to accurately simulate true reflection, shadows, and refraction, as well as the effects simulated by conventional shaders. Anti-aliasing is included as an integral part of the visibility calculations. Surfaces displayed include curved as well as polygonal surfaces.},

Our results demonstrate that the method is capable of drastic dynamic range compression, while preserving fine details and avoiding common artifacts, such as halos, gradient reversals, or loss of local contrast.

@article{citeulike:3783315,
	abstract = {Image processing often involves an image transformation into a domain that is better correlated with visual perception, such as the wavelet domain, image pyramids, multiscale-contrast representations, contrast in retinex algorithms, and chroma, lightness, and colorfulness predictors in color-appearance models. Many of these transformations are not ideally suited for image processing that significantly modifies an image. For example, the modification of a single band in a multiscale model leads to an unrealistic image with severe halo artifacts. Inspired by gradient domain methods, we derive a framework that imposes constraints on the entire set of contrasts in an image for a full range of spatial frequencies. This way, even severe image modifications do not reverse the polarity of contrast. The strengths of the framework are demonstrated by aggressive contrast enhancement and a visually appealing tone mapping, which does not introduce artifacts. In addition, we perceptually linearize contrast magnitudes using a custom transducer function. The transducer function has been derived especially for the purpose of HDR images, based on the contrast-discrimination measurements for high-contrast stimuli.},

However, they may execute for a long time for some difficult problems, because several fitness evaluations must be performed. A promising approach to overcome this limitation is to parallelize these algorithms. In this paper, we propose to implement a parallel EA on consumer-level graphics cards. We perform experiments to compare our parallel EA with an ordinary EA and demonstrate that the former is much more effective than the latter. Since consumer-level graphics cards are available in ubiquitous personal computers and these computers are easy to use and manage, more people are able to use our parallel algorithm to solve their problems encountered in real-world applications.},

The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input.
